        Creating the Map File
The map file itself can be in one of three formats: map, PHP, or CGI. The simplest format is the map format. If we were to use a map file to store the coordinates we used in our previous example we would type the following code into a text file:br
<br><br><br>
poly    https://facebook.com  30,100,140,50,290,220,180,280 poly    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media   190,75,200,60,495,60,495,165,275,165, 
That file would be saved as ismap.map and uploaded to the server.
